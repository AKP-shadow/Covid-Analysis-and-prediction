# COVID-19 Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains Python code for analyzing COVID-19 data and making predictions using machine learning. We use libraries such as Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, and Pandas for this analysis.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project and run the analysis.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid-analysis-prediction.git

```

### Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd covid-analysis-prediction
```

### Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Create one using the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip` by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Update the Dataset

Replace the dataset in the `data` directory with your own COVID-19 data in CSV format. Make sure to maintain the same structure (columns) as the sample dataset.

## Usage

You can run the analysis and prediction scripts from the project directory. Here are some example commands:

```bash
# Perform data analysis and generate visualizations
python analyze_data.py

# Train a prediction model and make predictions
python predict.py
```

Feel free to modify these scripts to suit your specific analysis and prediction needs.
